Appledoc Preview
================

Preview the appledoc rendering of a single header file.

Simply open a `*.h` file. Each file you will modify it from your favorite text editor (Xcode, vimâ€¦), this application will update it's generated content. It's a very simple way to verify if the comments you are writting are compatible with `appledoc`.
